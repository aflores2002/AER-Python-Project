# Used to choose what data to extract

# Reads original CSV file

# Filter to only show data which is in Metals Industry Sector and in Country_01
filtered = original[(original['Industry Sector'].isin(data)) & (original['Countries'].isin(country))]

# makes filtered data into a CSV file
filtered.to_csv("Filtered sampleDataset.csv")

# prints filtered data
print(filtered)

# This is a stepping stone to a possible solution, must implement new data when given Motec CSV files
# This code extracts all pieces of data from the sample that are in the Metals Industry Sector
